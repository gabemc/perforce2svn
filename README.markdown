# Perforce2Svn Migration Tool
This tool is designed to help you with relatively sophisticated migrations from a Perforce server into Subversion.  The Subvrsion repository must be on the file system for this command to function correctly.  If a repository does not exist, one will be created.

Currently, this software is incomplete and not yet functional.
